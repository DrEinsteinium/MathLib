# MathLib
This project is a simple math and util collection written in C#.  

The main purpose of this project is to give myself a whiteboard/sandbox style playground to design interesting implementations for use in future Unity projects. All of the math is designed around Unity's prexisting data structures such as Vector2, Vector3, Matrix4x4, ect.
